# Global Textile Waste: a GIS-spatial analysis  

"The practice of *waste colonialism*, where developed nations export their waste to less affluent countries, worsens these environmental and social injustices. By offloading their textile waste onto other nations... developed countries not only avoid the responsibility of managing their own waste but also contribute to the degradation of local economies and ecosystems in recipient countries." https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2024/07/02/scaling-the-mountains-of-textile-waste-in-new-york-city/ 

Main Issues: 
* High export volumes typically reflect high domestic consumption, production, and disposal of textiles, and often a lack of investment in domestic recycling or circular economy solutions.
* Major exporters like the United States, China, Germany, Italy, and France are among the world's largest generators of textile waste, driven by fast fashion and high turnover rates.
* Exporting waste instead of managing it domestically can be seen as a sign of unsustainable practices, especially if the waste is sent to countries that cannot process it safely or sustainably.
