# Global Textile Waste: a GIS-spatial analysis  

Inspiration for this project lies around 5,000 miles (8,000 kilometers) away from New York City, in one of the oldest and driest deserts in the world â€“ the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. From a distance, mounts of clothing and textile scraps seemingly blend in with the dunes and dry hills in the landscape. From up close, bright colors begin to stand out from discarded ripped jeans, leather boots, heals and old bracelets against the warm desert sand. 

The *Cemetery of Clothes*, as the locals refer to it, is a reflection of the effects of overproduction, fast fashion and a lack of policy regulations on the textile industry. An estimated **59,000 tons** of clothing and other textiles are imported to Chile each year, of which almost **40,000** deemed [irrecoverable](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2021/11/8/chiles-desert-dumping-ground-for-fast-fashion-leftovers). The growing piles permeate serious environmental impacts on the land, releasing toxic chemicals, like methane and formaldehyde, and contaminating the ground with imparishable microplastics. Fast fashion clothing is mainly made out of polyester (plastic), which is [non-biodegradable](https://earth.org/fast-fashions-detrimental-effect-on-the-environment/). With no proper management nor supervision, The Cemetery also presents an inevitable fire hazard as it spreads across 741 acres (300 hectares) of arid land.

"The practice of *waste colonialism*, where developed nations export their waste to less affluent countries, worsens these environmental and social injustices. By offloading their textile waste onto other nations... developed countries not only avoid the responsibility of managing their own waste but also contribute to the degradation of local economies and ecosystems in recipient countries." https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2024/07/02/scaling-the-mountains-of-textile-waste-in-new-york-city/ 

Main Issues: 
* High export volumes typically reflect high domestic consumption, production, and disposal of textiles, and often a lack of investment in domestic recycling or circular economy solutions.
* Major exporters like the United States, China, Germany, Italy, and France are among the world's largest generators of textile waste, driven by fast fashion and high turnover rates.
* Exporting waste instead of managing it domestically can be seen as a sign of unsustainable practices, especially if the waste is sent to countries that cannot process it safely or sustainably.
